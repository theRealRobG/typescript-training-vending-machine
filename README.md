# Typescript Training - Vending Machine
### For running TypeScript and Serving it
```
npm install typings@beta -g
npm install typings -g
npm install serve -g
```

### Init the project
In the root of the project run:
```
npm install
typings install
```

## Things to do
Some ideas:
- Implement what happens on pressing enter
- Implement restocking
- Implement payment

Also, `getContentForSlot` in `vendingMachine.ts` could be improved to be more resilient.
